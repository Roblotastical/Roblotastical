- 👋 Hi, I’m @Roblotastical
- 👀 I’m interested in Minecraft mods, and cheats/hacks of any kinds. Maybe some among us???
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and C++ (specifically VEXcode C++).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now... i'm not even that good at programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: @derppiez on twitter.
- I might be at the VEX Robotics State Qualifiers for Ohio, sometime in February, I think.
